### Summary of idea:

Our vision is to develop an intelligent, user-friendly system that streamlines the setup process for lab assignments, ensuring that students can focus on learning rather than the intricacies of environment configuration. By automating the environment setup, we aim to create a seamless, error-free process that adapts to various operating systems and Python versions, guaranteeing that every participant starts from a standardized, fully-prepared platform. This project will not only enhance the efficiency and accessibility of labs but also foster a more inclusive and engaging learning experience by removing technical barriers and allowing students to dive straight into coding.

### What problem or pain point does it solve?

The automated setup for Python labs significantly cuts down the time students spend on manual configurations, ensures a consistent coding environment across various systems, and shifts the focus from technical setup to the core learning of Python. This approach eliminates the technical hurdles and disparities, making coding more accessible and enjoyable for everyone involved. It democratizes the learning process, allowing students to dive straight into coding with a solid, uniform foundation.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.

### Domain Modeling

```
Draw out the entities for your project and how they are related to each other. Determine the relationships between the functions/methods and entities of your app.

Include in your domain model the names and data types of your entities and their properties.
